Assignment Requirements
-----------------------

For this assignment, implement a simple java library to work with mathematical graphs.  For our purposes, a graph is a collection of vertices and edges.  The vertices should be a user-defined type. The edges do not have to be user-defined, but should support arbitrary vertices.

Your library should support two kinds of graphs:
* Directed, where A->B is not the same as B->A
* Undirected, where A<->B is the same is B<->A

Both kinds of graphs should support 3 operations:
* addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
* addEdge - adds an edge to the graph
* getPath - returns a list of edges that form a path between two vertices (the path doesnâ€™t have to be optimal - any path will do)

The vertices should be of a user defined type.

Once finished, please share your code with us, and be prepared to answer the following questions (you don't have to implement these):
* How do you add support for weighted edges?
* How would you add a traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph?
* How would you make your graph operations thread safe?
